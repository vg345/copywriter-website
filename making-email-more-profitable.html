            <h2>Wanna make more profit from your emails?</h2> <br>
            <p>Are you using email to its full potential? Are you getting the conversions, the open rate, the click-through rate, that you hope for? </p>

      <section id="main" class="wrapper">
        <div class="container">
          <p>Email has a lot of hype around it. Well-deserved, but rarely accomplished. Are you getting everything that you can out of the emails you send to your subscribers? </p>
          <p>If your answer is yes, I have nothing to offer you. Not in this letter, anyway. Congratulations.</p>
          <p>If your answer is no, and if you want to do something about it, read on. </p>
          <p>I’m offering email copy that converts like crazy. Using strategic copywriting and storytelling techniques to do more than just sell your product. Using those techniques to build a fanbase of loyal customers. Second-time buyers. And third-time. And fourth-time. And as many times as you’d like. </p>
          <p>I’m only offering this for products and services I can personally claim to be a fan of. So please, if your product or service doesn’t come up to scratch, save us both some time. Don’t read any further.</p>
          <p>Here’s the price structure.</p>

          <ul class="alt">
            <li><strong>Single email</strong> : $200</li>
            <li><strong>5-email series</strong> :<s>$1000</s> $800 <br><em>Save $200</em></li>
            <li><strong>10-email series</strong> : <s>$2000</s> $1600 <br><em>Save $400 </em></li>
          </ul>
          <p>If you’re interested, fill out the five-minute questionnaire at the end and I’ll contact you ASAP. I’m not looking for a large number of clients. I’m only one person. If I write a hundred emails in a day, you can be sure that they all suck. </p>
          <p>I work with one or two clients at a time. You’re guaranteed 100% of my time and effort, and you’re guaranteed results. Plus, you don’t fill any credit card form or commit to the payment until I accept the project. </p>
          <p><strong>Bonus: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A-u7aWFnaeLuBlWrUNWRnyPRfi5EtOBN/view" target="_blank" >Crafting Stories That Sell</a></strong> available for download as a ‘thanks for being patient’ gift. I hope you enjoy it.</p>
